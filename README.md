# Bicyclelight
## A small statistic about the use of bicyclelight in winter

The usage of bicycle light was studied on weekdays between 21.10.2020 and 08.03.2021.

Area of the survey: Bicycle Path between Karlsruhe and Ettlingen/Bruchhausen in Germany

Each morning, the bicycles with and without their lights on were counted manually by myself. The test route was always the same with a fixed starting and end point. There were little differences in time. The time of data collection was roughly between 8:00 am and 8:30 am, which is the time I needed for this trip by bicycle. The route is used by a lot of commuters, some bicycles were counted most days.

Dates without data collection can be explained by:
* Weekends
* Holidays
* Snow
* Broken bicycle
* Getting confused by too many bikes to count at once
* Forgetting to count

Difficulties collecting the data:

* Bicycles with only one light on (back light or front light) were not considered, when noticed. Some cases like this might have been missed, therefore there might be cases in both groups.
* Very dim light
* Automatic light, which turns on when it is too dark, e.g. under a bridge
* People seen several times
